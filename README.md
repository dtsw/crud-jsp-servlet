# crud-jsp-servlet-bootstrap
Web CRUD Example using jee-web-api-6 (JSP 2.2, Servlet 3.0), Bootstrap 3.3.6, jQuery 1.9.1

Current app does not use any Database, and its functionality of List, Add and Remove can work similarly as a typical CRUD app, since in order to do an Update you can do Remove and Add together.

(I know I know Update is not Remove + Add, but this is a minimalistic CRUD ;-) )
